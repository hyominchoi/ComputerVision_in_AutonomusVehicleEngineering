# Self-Driving Car Engineering
Udacity Nanodegree Term 1 
---
In this term,  I learned and become fluent in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. Using camera data provided by Udacity Nanodegree program, I successfully completed the following projects.

 - [Project 1]: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
 - [Project 2]: Traffic Sign Classifier
 - [Project 3]: Behavioral Cloning
 - [Project 4]: Advanced Lane Finding. Here's a [link to my video result.](https://youtu.be/5uLRnO21Kq8)

 - [Project 5]: Vehicle Detection and Tracking. Here's a link to my video result: https://youtu.be/5vDbt8N8XuQ
